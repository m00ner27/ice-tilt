          The Ice Tilt Hockey League (ITHL) is a growing community of passionate NHL gamers who want to have fun playing with friends while making new ones. We've created a competitive environment that welcomes teams of all experience and skill levels - whether you're a seasoned veteran or brand new to the game, you'll find your place here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our main goal is to create a competitive environment for teams of all experience and skill levels. Super sweaty or brand new to the game, it doesn't matter - you will be considered a valued member of the league and community as long as you show respect to others.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
      <div class="space-y-4 text-white">
        <p>
          The ITHL started with humble beginnings - just 6 teams, an Excel spreadsheet, and an Instagram group chat. There was no website, no Discord server, just a passion for competitive EASHL hockey and a vision to create something special.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we've grown to over 80 active teams across both North America and Europe, with a full-featured website, active Discord community, and a thriving competitive environment. This growth is a testament to the dedication of our community and the fun, competitive atmosphere we've built together.
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage all teams to create social media accounts for their clubs. These accounts help enhance the rivalry aspect of the league, create memorable moments, and build the community spirit that makes the ITHL unique. Whether it's trash talk, highlight reels, or celebrating victories, team social media accounts add another layer of engagement and excitement to the league experience.

        <p class="text-white">
          The league is called the <strong>ICE TILT HOCKEY LEAGUE</strong> for a reason. We embrace and accept the fact that ice tilt is real. This game can create many unexpected and unique plays that end up tilting the ice in a certain direction. We don't try to stop 'ice tilt' from happening - we celebrate it as part of what makes EASHL exciting and unpredictable.

          Joining the ITHL allows players to get better at the game while meeting awesome people. We want the experience of playing in the ITHL to be like no other league. We put effort into making the league fun and engaging both on and off the ice, fostering friendships and rivalries that extend beyond the virtual rink.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Bring Your Own Club</h3>
        <p class="text-white">
          The ITHL is a 'Bring Your Own Club' league. Every team shares one thing in common: they are a group of friends that want to have fun playing competitive EASHL. We believe that teams work best when they consist of people who get along and enjoy playing together.

        <p class="text-white">
          While we want people to take both the game and league seriously, we also want people to understand that it isn't life or death. We value positive team culture and sportsmanship just as much as skill. Things may happen throughout the season that aren't accounted for in the rules, and our Admin team will do their best to resolve every issue as fairly as possible.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Flexible Game Scheduling</h3>
        <p class="text-white mb-3">
          The ITHL understands that teams have varying schedules, so we don't have set game times. This allows teams flexibility while maintaining structure. League weeks run from Monday through Sunday, and each week General Managers are responsible for arranging games with their scheduled opponents.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white mb-3">
          To ensure games can be played within the 7-day league week, clubs must be available to play at least 3 out of 5 nights every week (Monday through Thursday, and Sunday). Games can also be played on Friday or Saturday, but these nights don't count toward the availability requirement.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white">
          Game series are expected to start between 9:00 - 9:30 PM EST each night for North American players, and between 20:00 - 21:00 CET for European players (the most reasonable times considering both East and West players in each region). That said, games can be scheduled for any time that works for both teams. If matchups cannot be scheduled within a given league week, both clubs' availability will be reviewed by the Admin team.

      <div class="space-y-4 text-white">
        <p>
          Since the ITHL is a 'Bring Your Own Club' league, it can sometimes be challenging for free agents to find teams. We understand this difficulty and are actively working on developing a new system to help players looking for a team connect with clubs that need players.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, free agents can join the ITHL Discord server and post their information in the <strong>#free-agents</strong> channel. Additionally, players can check the <strong>#scouting-discords</strong> channel to find team-specific Discord servers where they might find opportunities to join a club.
