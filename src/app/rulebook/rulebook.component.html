        <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
          <p>The ITHL is a growing community full of people that want to have fun playing NHL with their friends while making new ones.</p>
          <p>A lot of new members might not fully understand the intent of the ITHL and everyone needs to recognize what we are trying to do with the league before they get started with it.</p>
          <p>The ITHL's main goal is to create a competitive environment for teams of all experience and skill levels. Super sweaty or brand new to the game, it doesn't matter - you will be considered a valued member of the league and community as long as you show respect to others.</p>
          <p>Joining the ITHL allows players to get better at the game while meeting awesome people. We want the experience of playing in the ITHL to be like no other league. We put effort into making the league fun and engaging both on and off the ice.</p>
          <p>The league is called the <strong>ICE TILT HOCKEY LEAGUE</strong> for a reason. We embrace and accept the fact that ice tilt is real. This game can create many unexpected and unique plays that end up tilting the ice in a certain direction. In some cases our rule book doesn't try and stop 'ice tilt' from happening, and that is important to understand.</p>
          <p>The ITHL is meant for people to have fun with friends while playing EASHL. While we want people to take both the game and league seriously; at the same time we want people to understand that it isn't life or death. Things may happen throughout the season that are not accounted for in the rules. The Admin team will do their best to resolve every issue as fairly as possible.</p>
          <p>Problems will come up throughout the season so it is important to be understanding, cooperative and reasonable when dealing with league issues.</p>

          <p>The ITHL is a 'Bring Your Own Club' League. It is important for everyone to understand that there are a wide variety of Clubs in the ITHL. Every team shares one thing in common; they are a group of friends that want to have fun playing competitive EASHL.</p>
          
          <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">1.3.1 Club Make Up</h4>
          <p>The BYOC style only works if each team consists of people that get along and like each other. Please do not make a team full of skilled players that don't necessarily like or trust each other. Teams need to have a sense of cohesiveness, and players need to enjoy playing with each other.</p>
          <p>The ITHL wants teams to have fun before sweating too hard. We appreciate teams that take the league seriously, but there must be some sort of 'Positive Team Culture' within your Club.</p>
          <p>Feedback will be taken from GMs during the season to provide insight on how easy or hard it is to communicate with other GMs to set up games. Additionally, GMs will be able to provide feedback in the event of any "rage quitting", "trolling", or "griefing" during the season. If multiple issues arise regarding a particular team, the individuals involved from that team may not be allowed to participate in future seasons with their GM also not allowed to GM other teams.</p>

        <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
          <p>Before being accepted into the league as a General Manager (GM), an individual must fully understand the expectations and responsibilities that come with the position. To ensure this, prospective GMs must complete a rules-based screening process, which includes answering a series of questions about the league's rules. A minimum score of 80% is required to be approved as a GM.</p>
          <p>Any player designated as an Assistant General Manager (AGM) on the website will be held to the same standards and responsibilities as a GM. This means that communication from an AGM with other teams will be considered official and treated with the same authority as communication from a GM.</p>
          <p>While all players are expected to be familiar with the league rules, GMs have the added responsibility of ensuring their team members are well-informed throughout the season.</p>

          <p>Clubs must be available to play at least 3 out of 5 nights every week (Monday - Thursday, Sunday).</p>
          <p>Due to 'no set game times', being available 3 out of 5 nights every week ensures that games will be able to be played within the 7 day League Week.</p>
          <p>That said, games can be played on Friday or Saturday but won't be counted towards Availability.</p>
          <p>Availability will be after 9 EST every night. (The most reasonable time considering both East and West players).</p>
          <p>If matchups cannot be scheduled within the given League Week, both team's availability will be reviewed by the Admin team. The team deemed to have more of a liability towards not being able to schedule a time will be forfeited. If it is both team's fault, 1 win and 1 loss will be given to each team.</p>
          <p>If you do not have proof of your team's availability throughout the week, it may be used against you when deciding what team is at fault for not finding a game time. This is why we recommend teams format their availability like the picture attached above.</p>

          <p>That said, games can be scheduled for any time.</p>
